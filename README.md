It converts currencies all over the world instantly. 
This is a web-based currency converter application that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates from the ExchangeRate-API. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A js file containing list of 158 countries and their currency code is provided . You can get your own API key from ExchangeRate-API for free. I have used FlagsAPI and fontawesome for icons.
